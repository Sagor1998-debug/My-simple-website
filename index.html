            A nuclear bomb is a weapon of mass destruction that utilizes nuclear reactions, either fission (splitting atoms) or a combination of fission and fusion (thermonuclear), to create a powerful explosion. These weapons are capable of causing widespread devastation and casualties due to the intense heat, blast, and radiation released during detonation.
